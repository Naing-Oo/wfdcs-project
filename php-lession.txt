=> PHP Syntax
A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.
A PHP script starts with <?php and ends with ?>:

<?php
    // PHP code goes here
?>

The default file extension for PHP files is ".php".

Below, we have an example of a simple PHP file,
with a PHP script that uses a built-in PHP function "echo" 
to output the text "Hello World!" on a web page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

    <h1>My first PHP page</h1>

    <?php
    echo "Hello World!";
    ?>

</body>
</html>

== PHP Variables

$x = 5;
$y = "John";

PHP supports the following data types:
String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource
